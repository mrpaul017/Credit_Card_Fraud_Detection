I analyzed a dataset from Kaggle containing credit card transactions and made a model that can recognize fraudulent transactions so that so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## Steps in this project:
- Importing libraries
- Analyzing and cleaning the data
- Feature scaling
- Preparing and applying varieties of models
- Choosing the best performing model
- Saving the model
